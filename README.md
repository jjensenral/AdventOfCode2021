# AdventOfCode2021
Advent of Code done in functional style

## Goals

This is an attempt at solving [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
until I run out of time (last year got a bit too challenging on top of the day job).

Since the aim is to solve the problems, I will do the challenge in Common
Lisp since it is easy to rapidly prototype and usually results in fairly elegant
code.  It is tested with SBCL on my very slow laptop.

The aim is to use a functional style whenever it makes sense, choosing procedural
only when it is shorter or necessary for some other reason.
